== Description ==

This plugin enables the retreival of information on United Kingdom Members of Parliament, based upon postcode.

Insert shortcode [find-your-mp] into a post where you want the plugin to appear.

Also ensure that you have a php.ini file in your root directory containing the line allow_url_fopen = true.

The only setting required is an API key from TheyWorkForYou, see http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/.

There is no formal website or support, but I can answer occasional queries at rupert@AtheismUK.com.
